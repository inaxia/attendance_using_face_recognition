# Contributing to Inaxia
Want to contribute to Inaxia?<br>
Great! First, read this page and also the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/inaxia/attendance_using_face_recognition/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before you start contributing.

## How to Contribute
First, run the code in your local computer and try to understand the code.<br>
If you see a bug or have an idea that you feel would improve one
of the repository.<br>
You can go ahead:

1. File an issue
2. Explain your issue in detail
3. Ask questions if you don't unsterstand any part of code
4. Add an image to support your point
5. And don't forget to tag a maintainer
6. Start working on an issue only after a maintainer will assign you to do a purticular work

It will help avoid a situation in which you spend a lot of time coding something that's not quite right for the repo or its goals.

## Reviewing

The maintainers are:

- [@Hardikkr](https://github.com/Hardikkr)

You are free to tag any maintainer in any issue or PR sent to any repo.<br> 
We're happy to comment, answer (or ask) questions, and provide feedback.

## Ground Rules
Changes should:

- follow a specific code format
- have no errors or warnings
- avoid adding any unusual assets to any repo

You're always welcome to contribute to Inaxia.
